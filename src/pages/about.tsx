      <h1>Hi, I'm Nir!</h1>

      <p>I'm a passionate innovative software developer.üë®‚Äçüíª</p>
      <p>My mission is to help people succeed where they struggle alone</p>
      <p>
        My life journey revolves around computers, coding and making life better
        with technology. I am taking part in software development projects,
        mainly on the world wide web, while starting new innovations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My vision is to keep developing in the computer science field while
        passing knowledge to whomever I can, and finding great solutions for
        different kinds of problems. I think the key to success is good
        cooperation between people and hard work. ü§ùüí™

        I started my professional career as an intern at Intel while I was a
        student for a Bachelor's degree in computer science at the Hebrew
        University of Jerusalem. In my studies, I had the chance to work on a
        variety of interesting and complex coding projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, as as I moved to a full-time software developer position at
        Intel, I worked on a variety of projects such as desktop applications,
        server implementations, web apps, mobile apps and much more. These
        required "Full Stack" abilities such as low level and high-level
        programming language skills, and a wide knowledge of different platforms
        and problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, as a full-time software developer at Curv, an exciting new
        startup, I work on blockchain software solutions focusing on the
        client-side using mainly ReactJS.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I am working on my own projects for two main reasons -
        learning new technologies and making an impact (for example, knowledge
        sharing and finding different ways to enhance productivity).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like to lead people and manage great projects, Through the years
        I have organized many events and professional workshops. In my Army
        service, I was an officer and led people both professionally and
        personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also fascinated with the world of finance, especially the stock
        market.
